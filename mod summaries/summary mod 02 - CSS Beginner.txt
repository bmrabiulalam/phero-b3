interviewer may ask about box model:
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. 
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content with height and width. 

.boxmodel{
 margin:;
 border:;
 padding:;
 height:;
 weight:;
}

2-9 Text align, float, display, inline, block, inline-block, external CSS

Text align: center/left/right/justify

float: 
The float Property

The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

display:
The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
e.g.
    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    <form>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <section>


Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
e.g. 
    <span>
    <a>
    <img>


inline-block:
it is used to display block elements inline.
like: >> block1 block2 block3 <<

external CSS
put the css in a seperate file with .css exention for reuse
